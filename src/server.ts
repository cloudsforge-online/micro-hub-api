/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Plain `node:http`, following the template. The parts that matter — request ids, RED metrics, the
 * child logger, the error shape, the auth-fault mapping — are framework-independent, and the four
 * health handlers are what CI checks for (rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2).
 *
 * The one decision that is easy to get backwards is the auth-fault mapping. A bad token is 401. A
 * verifier that could not reach the JWKS is **503**, never 401 — answering 401 there signs every
 * user in the estate out because the identity service is having a bad minute.
 *
 * ── This service refuses a service token ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every route below requires a *user* principal. A BFF is a view for a human being holding a
 * session; there is no such thing as a service's dashboard, and accepting a service token here
 * would create a route by which any credential in the estate could read any user's portfolio,
 * wallets, security state and activity in one call. That is a much larger authority than any of
 * the eight upstreams grants individually, and it would exist only because this service composes
 * them. An operator with the `admin` role may name `?userId=`, which is the one supported way to
 * look at somebody else's dashboard — and even then the security tile degrades rather than
 * forwarding the operator's own identity as if it were the subject's.
 *
 * ── Why nothing here returns 500 for an upstream fault ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `composeDashboard` resolves whatever happens. A route that caught its result and turned a
 * degraded page into a 503 would undo the entire design.

     * the same three-millisecond observation on `hub_upstream_ms`, and the credential case looked
     * BETTER than healthy because a call that never left the process is fast.
     *
     * `outcome` is `ResultEvent`'s union from `@cloudsforge/http`, and `token_unavailable` is the

     * remedy printed beside it sent them to a healthy service (micro-org#351). A reason code only
     * ends that if an operator can select on it, and selecting means a label.
     *
     * `circuit_open` is here for the same reason and is worth its own alert: it means this process
     * refused its own call, so it will not appear in the peer's logs at all.
     *
     * **The label list is not decoration.** `@cloudsforge/telemetry` drops any label a spec does
     * not declare — silently until 1.0.1, which is how ledger's identical counter has been writing

     * THE FIRST FIVE ROUTES ON THIS SERVICE THAT ARE NOT COMPOSITIONS, AND THE FIRST TWO THAT
     * MOVE MONEY.
     *
     * Everything above this line fans out to several upstreams and returns tiles: a failure is a
     * status on one tile and the page still draws. These five are PROXIES of one route each on
     * micro-wallet, and they behave differently on purpose.
     *
     *   - The two reads are still tiles, because they are lists on a page that has other lists on
     *     it, and a wallet outage should cost that page one panel rather than the whole screen.
     *   - The DETAIL read is not a tile. A tile's `empty` for a single record would be a conversion
     *     that does not exist, rendered as though it did.
     *   - The two writes are not tiles either, and their refusals are forwarded verbatim — see
     *     `UpstreamRefusalError`. A 409 `desk_inventory_short` that arrived at the browser as a 500
     *     would turn "we are out of EMBER, try a smaller amount" into "something went wrong", which
     *     is the difference between a user who knows what to do next and a support ticket.
     *
     * WHY hub-web CALLS THESE AT ALL, when it calls micro-wallet directly for withdrawals: because
     * this is the seam micro-org#496 asked for, and because the two reads need `?userId=` for the
     * operator view that `resolveSubject` already owns. The write routes forward the reader's own
     * bearer and gain this service no authority it did not have — `Upstreams.quoteConversion` has
     * the argument, and it is about `UPSTREAM_SCOPES.wallet` being a read credential.

 * in `tiles.ts` states the rule those follow: the reason is built from the error's CLASS and never
 * from a response body, because "putting that in a field a browser renders is a stored-XSS primitive
 * with extra steps". This is the one place that rule is departed from, and the departure is narrow
 * enough to state exactly:
 *
 *   - It applies only to the desk routes, which are proxies of ONE named route on ONE named peer.
 *     A tile's fault could have come from any of eight upstreams, including one that answers HTML
 *     from a captive portal; this could not.
 *   - Only a status the peer DECIDED is forwarded (`FORWARDED_STATUSES`). A 500, a timeout, a
 *     transport error and an open breaker are not decisions about this request and are still the
 *     generic 500 above.
 *   - Only a body that parses as the estate's own error envelope is forwarded, the code must look
 *     like a code, and the message is bounded. Anything else falls back to the generic path — so an
 *     upstream that starts answering something unexpected degrades to "the request could not be
 *     completed" rather than to whatever it answered.
 *
 * What it buys is the whole point of micro-org#496: `desk_inventory_short` says "the desk is out of
 * EMBER right now — try a smaller amount, or try again shortly", and a person who reads that knows
 * what to do. Re-writing it here would be a second copy of wallet's words, free to drift from the
 * first, and the estate has that failure written down in three other places.

 * know". wallet's `rate_unavailable` is a 503 and it IS a decision about this request — pricing has
 * no usable quote for this pair, so the conversion is refused rather than guessed at a made-up rate.
 * A user who sees "try again shortly" acts correctly on it; a 500 would send them to support.
 * The envelope check below is what keeps a genuine unlabelled 503 out.
 *
 * 401 and 403 are deliberately ABSENT. This service verified the reader's token before forwarding
 * it, so wallet disagreeing means the two disagree about identity — a fault in the estate, not in
 * the request. Forwarding a 401 would make the browser refresh and then sign the reader out over it.
