 * THIS FIXTURE CONTAINS HYPHENS ON PURPOSE, AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT IT.
 *
 * A credential body is base64**url**, so `-` and `_` are in its alphabet. Measured on the running
 * estates: the mainnet credential is alphanumeric and the testnet one CONTAINS A HYPHEN. So a
 * "secrets have no hyphens" rule — correct for a generated HMAC key, and what every placeholder
 * this estate wrote would have failed — passes mainnet and kills testnet at boot. One environment
 * healthy, one dead, from a rule that reads as obviously right in review.
 *
 * Keeping a hyphenated credential here means that mistake fails CI instead of failing one estate in
 * production. Do not "tidy" the hyphens out of this value.
 *
 * The literal it replaces was `cfsc_a-long-lived-credential-that-does-not-expire`: the right prefix
 * and the right length, and 3.5 bits per character of entropy — English prose, i.e. a value the
 * guard is specifically there to refuse. A fixture that could not survive the check it is meant to
 * demonstrate documents the absence of one.
