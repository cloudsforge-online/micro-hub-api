/**
 * **The ten-minute cliff, end to end, through the wiring this service actually uses.**
 *
 * `@cloudsforge/auth` proves the provider in isolation. This file proves the ADOPTION.
 *
 *     token: () => token        // upstreams.ts, six times, before this change
 *
 * Six strings read once at boot from tokens that expire in 600 seconds
 * (identity/src/tokens.ts), which nothing could re-mint because minting required the `admin`
 * role. Ten minutes into every deployment all six died at once and every tile on the dashboard
 * went `unavailable` — the widest blast radius of the defect anywhere in the estate, because this
 * is the surface a user actually looks at.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE COULD NOT SEE IT. Every other test here builds clients against a fake estate and
 * calls them immediately, so a token is never asked to survive its own lifetime. **A test that
 * mints a token and immediately uses it proves nothing about this defect.** The tests below move a
 * simulated clock eleven minutes past a token already held, assert it is REFUSED BY A REAL
 * `Verifier`, and only then assert a tile still renders.
 *
 * They go through the real `httpUpstreams`, not a hand-rolled provider: "the provider is correct"
 * and "the provider is wired in" are separate failures, and only the second was ever the bug.
